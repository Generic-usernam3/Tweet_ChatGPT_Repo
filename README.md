This is a Repository for our Datascience project. So far, we have taken Tweets taken from Twitter's Api and Generated fake tweets using ChatGpt. We have approximately 7000 tweets in total ( both real and fake ). The file is Tweet_Repo.csv


We fine-tuned a bert model- the code is included in Final_Project.ipynb


Our fine-tuned model is available on the huggingface hub as : Generic-usernam3/Tweet_Chatgpt
